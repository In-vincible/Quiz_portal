Portfolio Weighting with Constraints
See attached xlsx
Each ISIN should be weighted by freeFloatMcap
Contraints are:
                                                    i.     max weight per ISIN is 10%

                                                   ii.     max overall weight for names >5% weight is 50%

                                                  iii.     excess weight to be redistributed across names which are not capped
